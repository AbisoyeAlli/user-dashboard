# DRPG Coding Test

## Install dependencies

`yarn install` to install all dependencies.

then run command `yarn start` to get the project running locally.

## Dependencies

I installed the following;

- `MaterialUI` components to save time spent on building required components.
- `Axios` to handle API calls
- `Jest` for tests

## Further work

If I had more time, I would write more test cases and also implement stricter validations for all input fields.
